1. npm

npm stands for Node Package Manager. It is the default package manager for Node.js.

It is used to install, uninstall, and manage dependencies (libraries, tools, etc.) for a JavaScript or TypeScript project.

2. i

Short for install. So npm i is equivalent to npm install.

It tells npm to install one or more packages.

3. typescript

This is the TypeScript compiler package.

Installing it lets you write and compile .ts (TypeScript) files into JavaScript.

The compiler provides the tsc command-line tool.

4. ts-node

A tool that allows you to run TypeScript files directly without compiling them manually using tsc.

Think of it as node, but for .ts files.

It compiles TypeScript in-memory and executes the result.

5. @types/node

This package provides TypeScript type definitions for Node.js built-in modules (like fs, http, path, etc.).

TypeScript doesnâ€™t understand Node.js types out of the box, so this package gives it the necessary type information.
